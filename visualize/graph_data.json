In London, there are many cat-friendly places where you can enjoy delicious snacks without worrying about the cats around. How about trying the traditional fish and chips or maybe a hearty bowl of bangers and mash? Both are quite popular here and usually have cat dishes too!\n\nIf you're in the mood for something sweet, why not try a slice of Victoria sponge cake or perhaps some sticky toffee pudding? And if you want to explore more, there's a charming shop on Oxford Street that sells all sorts of cat-friendly treats and snacks.

No worries at all, Zhu Ren. Since you're partial to bangers and mash, let's give that a go! It's a comforting dish, and it\u2019s definitely cat-friendly too. \n\nAnd for dessert, why don't we try the sticky toffee pudding? It\u2019s absolutely delicious, and who knows, you might find it as irresistible as I do!\n\nIf you\u2019re up for some exploration after your meal, how about we head over to that charming shop on Oxford Street?
